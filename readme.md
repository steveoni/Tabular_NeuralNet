## Tabular data With Neural Network
Neural Network over the years have always being used for unstructured data. But recently the winner of some kaggle [competition](http://blog.kaggle.com/2015/07/27/taxi-trajectory-winners-interview-1st-place-team-%F0%9F%9A%95/) and also used py company like [pinterest](https://medium.com/the-graph/applying-deep-learning-to-related-pins-a6fee3c92f5e) and [inscart](https://tech.instacart.com/deep-learning-with-emojis-not-math-660ba1ad6cdc). The embeddings learn about the relationship in the categorical variable which then can help improve our model

I decided to test neural net on tabulae dataset on [zindi](https://zindi.africa/) during this [competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/mobile-money-and-financial-inclusion-in-tanzania-challenge). the Neural net gave an accuracy of 68-70% accuracy base on the feature engineering use and a score of 0.77 - 0.76 on the leader board.

The machine learning perform better since the training set is small , it has `7094` rows. But i believe for a more large dataset the neural net will perform better.

To work with the notebook download the data set from zindi.africa
